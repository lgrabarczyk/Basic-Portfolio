<p>I remember in high school my father telling me "You should probably take an art class, you might just like it". I of course didn't listen. I felt that such a career was not substantial enough for me. Big mistake. What can I say I was in high school. I had no idea of who I was or what career path to take. After experimenting with many different majors in college: psychology, sociology, music, and dentistry I accidently became involved with my college yearbook. It was love at first layout. Design became my passion. Shortly after becoming editor-in-chief I looked into art schools. At that time I had discovered a new career, Art Director. I looked around and found one of the best graphic design schools: Pratt Intitute. To my surprise not only did they like my yearbook layouts, they wanted me to start as soon as possible. They told me they really liked the designs. Who knew? The rest is a long 35year journey...
